"Whether it matters which group a ticket is purchased in. If you're selling "
"tickets based on the purchaser (Adult, Child, etc.), it doesn't matter which "
"group it's in. You have 250 tickets, and it's perfectly plausible for all "
"250 to be in one category. This is \"continuous\" counting. You have a "
"specific total number of tickets, and whichever type of ticket is sold, the "
"number is subtracted from the total number of tickets. With \"discrete\" "
"sections (Gallery, Balcony, etc.), it <strong>does</strong> matter which "
"group a ticket is sold from. You have only 50 tickets in Section A, but 100 "
